1. Baseline: As a programmer, want to store purchasing and customer information in this program, to complete my assignment. 1


2. As an accountant at Bulk Club, I want to generate a daily sales report to organize our sales figures. 
This will require a menu option with which to select the creation of the sales report. 
Additionally this requires the formating of the output, and access to the list of sales. 4


3. As a member of Bulk Club, I want to be able to find a list of my total purchases to keep track of my shopping. 
This will require a menu option to differentiate members from employees, a search list function to locate members 
transactions based on their number, and output formatted in a palatable manner. 3


4. As an inventory manager at Bulk Club, I want to be able to find the price and quantity of a given item to keep
track of inventory. This needs a search function and a counter in order to work. 2


5. As a manager at Bulk Club, I want to generate a report that lists all items sold. To do this we, the programmers,
need to keep an updated file of the sales that have occurred marked by the date in order to keep a consistent record. 
Output has already been formatted by this point for the most part. 2


6. As a manager at Bulk Club, I want to generate a report that lists the rebates of all preferred members.
This will run a loop that calculates and stores the rebate for each of the preferred members. 3


7. As a customer service representative at Bulk Club, I want to generate a list of membership expirations for a given month 
to be able to send reminders to members. As such, we will need to check the payments and the dates of memberships and 
include a check that triggers a reminder for the employees to send to the bulk club members. 4


8. As a customer service manager at Bulk Club, I want to add to and delete members from our membership roster to have
an idea of the number of members we have to service. Adding and deleting members from a linked list. 2


9. As a sales analyst at Bulk Club, I want to be able to save changes between executions of this program so that it
helps us see the long-term picture of member activity at our stores. We will need to create a file and output the results
of each change to the program to this file, named based on the date. 3?


10. As a member of Bulk Club, I would like to know whether it would be advantageous to switch from basic to preferred
membership. We need to check to see if the difference between the membership cost and the rebate is significant to the
customers and program in an alert to change their membership status. 4
